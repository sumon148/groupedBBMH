### Overview of the **groupedBBMH** R Package

The **groupedBBMH** R package implements a **nested beta-binomial hierarchical model** designed for **group-testing data in biosecurity surveillance**, where the primary goal is to efficiently detect rare contamination events. In routine inspections of imported agricultural consignments, only group-level binary outcomes—positive or negative—are observed, without information on the exact number of contaminated items. This package extends traditional beta-binomial modeling to incorporate **imperfect test sensitivity and specificity**, offering both **exact inference** using a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm and **fast approximate estimation** via a beta-binomial approximation. It supports estimation of contamination levels, quantifies the risk of undetected contamination, and aids in risk-based decision-making through model-based simulation.

#### Case Study: Frozen Prawn Importation

To illustrate the method, consider a biosecurity context involving the importation of frozen prawns into Australia. Annually, around 800 consignments (batches) are imported, with each batch containing approximately $B = 8000$ bags. A simple random sample of $b = 13$ bags is tested per batch. From each selected bag, a group of $m = 5$ prawns (out of $M = 40$) is randomly selected, leading to $n = bm = 65$ sampled prawns per batch. Each group of 5 prawns is tested using a PCR test with sensitivity $\Delta = 0.70$ and specificity $\Lambda = 0.99$. The only observation per batch is the number of groups testing positive, out of the $b=13$ tested.

Let $X_{ij}$ represent the number of contaminated prawns in bag $j$ of batch $i$. Instead of directly observing $X_{ij}$, we observe $Y_{ij}$, where $Y_{ij} = 1$ if any prawn in the group is contaminated, and 0 otherwise.

Let define the total contamination as $T_{Xi} = \sum_{j=1}^B \sum_{k=1}^M X_{ijk}$, and the sample contamination as $t_{xi(m)} = \sum_{j=1}^b \sum_{k=1}^m X_{ijk}$. Similarly, $T_{Yi(M)} = \sum_{j=1}^B Y_{ij}$ and $t_{yi(m)} = \sum_{j=1}^b Y_{ij}$ are the total and sampled number of contaminated bags, respectively.

A key quantity of interest is \textbf{leakage}, defined as:

$$
L_i = T_{Xi} \cdot \mathbb{I}(t_{yi(m)} = 0),
$$

representing the number of contaminated prawns entering undetected when no sampled group tests positive. We focus on:

* the **expected leakage** $\mathbb{E}(L_i)$,
* the **probability of leakage** $\Pr(L_i > 0)$,
* and posterior inference on $T_{Xi}$ when $t_{yi(m)} = 0$.

Now let $p_i$ denote the true prevalence of contamination in batch $i$, and define $\phi_{i(m)} = 1 - (1 - p_i)^m$ as the probability that a pool of $m$ ($\ 1 \le m \le M$) prawns is contaminated. Assuming prawns are randomly distributed among bags, we have:

$$
X_{ij} \mid p_i \overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \text{Bin}(M, p_i), \quad p_i \overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta).
$$

Thus, the group-level test outcome $Y_{ij}$ follows:

$$
Y_{ij} \mid p_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\phi_i), \quad \phi_i = 1 - (1 - p_i)^m,
$$

and the observed number of positive groups in the sample is:

$$
t_{yi} \mid p_i \sim \text{Binomial}(b, \phi_i).
$$

To incorporate **imperfect testing**, we define the effective probability of a positive test as:

$$
\tilde{\phi}_{\Delta\Lambda}(p_i) = \Delta \phi(p_i) + (1 - \Lambda)(1 - \phi(p_i)).
$$

Under perfect specificity ($\Lambda = 1$), this simplifies to:

$$
\tilde{\phi}_\Delta(p_i) = \Delta \phi(p_i).
$$

When $\beta \gg \alpha$, the contamination prevalence $p_i$ is approximately Gamma distributed, leading to:

$$
\tilde{\phi}_{\Delta\Lambda} \sim (1 - \Lambda) + \text{Beta} \left( \alpha, \frac{\beta}{m(\Delta + \Lambda - 1)} \right).
$$

Two important special cases:

* **Perfect testing** ($\Delta = 1$, $\Lambda = 1$): $\tilde{\phi} \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta / m)$,
* **Perfect specificity** ($\Lambda = 1$): $\tilde{\phi} \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta / (m \Delta))$.

In either case, $t_{yi}$ approximately follows a Beta-Binomial distribution:

$$
t_{yi} \sim \text{Beta-Binomial}(b, \alpha, \beta / (m\Delta)).
$$

#### Threshold-Based Risk Estimation

In the context of the prawn biosecurity study, suppose a regulatory threshold is set such that contamination levels below a certain prevalence cut-off are considered acceptable for import. Suppose a regulatory cut-off $k$ is introduced, such that contamination prevalence below $k$ is considered acceptable. The effective prevalence becomes:

$$
p_i = p_i \cdot \mathbb{I}(p_i > k), \quad p_i \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta).
$$

Using this truncated model, the **probability of leakage** becomes:

$$
\Pr[L_i > 0] = \frac{B_{(k_1,1)}(\alpha, \frac{\beta}{m\Delta} + b)}{B(\alpha, \frac{\beta}{m\Delta})} - \frac{B_{(k,1)}(\alpha, \beta + MB)}{B(\alpha, \beta)},
$$

with $k_1 = \Delta(1 - (1 - k)^m)$. Under perfect testing:

$$
\Pr[L_i > 0] = \frac{B_{(k,1)}(\alpha, \beta + mb)}{B(\alpha, \beta)} - \frac{B_{(k,1)}(\alpha, \beta + MB)}{B(\alpha, \beta)}.
$$

When $k = 0$, this reduces to the standard beta-binomial case.

The **expected leakage** under threshold $k$ is:

$$
\mathbb{E}(L_i) = (B - b) M \cdot \mathbb{E}\left[ (1 - p_i)^{bm\Delta} \cdot p_i \cdot \mathbb{I}(p_i > k) \right],
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
\mathbb{E}(L_i) = (B - b) M \cdot \frac{B_{(k,1)}(\alpha + 1, \beta + bm\Delta)}{B(\alpha, \beta)}.
$$

# groupedBBMH

The **groupedBBMH** R package implements a **nested beta-binomial hierarchical model** designed for **group-testing data in biosecurity surveillance**, where the primary goal is to efficiently detect rare contamination events. In routine inspections of imported agricultural consignments, only group-level binary outcomes—positive or negative—are observed, without information on the exact number of contaminated items. This package extends traditional beta-binomial modeling to incorporate **imperfect test sensitivity and specificity**, offering both **exact inference** using a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm and **fast approximate estimation** via a beta-binomial approximation. It supports estimation of contamination levels, quantifies the risk of undetected contamination, and aids in risk-based decision-making through model-based simulation.

To illustrate the method, consider a biosecurity scenario involving the importation of frozen seafood into Australia. Suppose there are $D$ consignments (or batches), each consisting of approximately $B$ groups, with each group containing $m$ items — so that the total number of items per batch is $N = mB$.

From each batch, a simple random sample of $b$ groups is selected for group testing. These tests, which screen for pathogens or contaminants, are typically imperfect. We assume a constant sensitivity $\Delta$ — the probability that a test correctly detects infection when it is present — and a constant specificity $\Lambda$ — the probability that a test correctly identifies no infection when it is absent.

For each batch, the only observed outcome is the number of positive groups among the $b$ tested.


Let ( X_{ij\ell} ) indicate contamination status (1 = contaminated, 0 = not) for unit ( \ell ) in group ( j ) of consignment ( i ), where ( j = 1, \ldots, b ) and ( \ell = 1, \ldots, m ). The total contaminated units in group ( j ) of consignment ( i ) is ( X_{ij} = \sum_{\ell=1}^{m} X_{ij\ell} ), taking values ( 0, 1, \ldots, m ).

The values ( X_{ij} ) are not directly observed. Instead, we observe ( Y_{ij} = I(X_{ij} > 0) ), indicating whether any contamination is present in group ( j ). Define:

* ( T_{Xi} = \sum_{j=1}^B X_{ij} ): total contaminated units in consignment ( i ),
* ( t_{xi} = \sum_{j=1}^{b} X_{ij} ): contaminated units in the sampled groups,
* ( t_{yi} = \sum_{j=1}^{b} Y_{ij} ): number of sampled groups with contamination, ranging from 0 to ( b ).


Considering measurement error of the test, we let $\widetilde{Y}_{ij}$ be the test result for group $j$ in consignment $i$, with 1 denoting a positive result (i.e., apparent contamination) and 0 denoting a negative result (apparently contamination-free). It follows that $\pr \left( \widetilde{Y}_{ij} = 1 \vert Y_{ij} \right) = \Delta Y_{ij} + \left( 1-\Lambda \right) \left(1-Y_{ij}\right)$. The available data are values of $\tilde{t}_{yi}$.

We define the \textit{leakage} (sometimes referred to as slippage) to equal $L_i=T_{Xi} I\left( \tilde{t}_{yi}=0 \right)$, which is the number of contaminated units (prawns) imported in consignment $i$, reflecting the fact that consignments are blocked if there are any positive test results. We consider the expected leakage $\E(L_i)$ and the probability of leakage $\pr(L_i>0)$ under plausible statistical models fitted to a 

A key quantity of interest is \textbf{leakage}, defined as:

\[
L_i=T_{Xi} I\left( \tilde{t}_{yi}=0 \right),
\]

representing the number of contaminated items entering undetected when no sampled group tests positive. We focus on:

* the **expected leakage** $\mathbb{E}(L_i)$,
* the **probability of leakage** $\Pr(L_i > 0)$,
* and posterior inference on $T_{Xi}$ when $\tilde{t}_{yi}=0$.

Now let $p_i$ denote the true prevalence of contamination in batch $i$, and define $\phi_{i} = 1 - (1 - p_i)^m$ as the probability that a pool of $m$ ($\ 1 \le m \le M$) items is contaminated. Assuming items are randomly distributed among bags, we have:

\[
X_{ij} \mid p_i \overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \text{Bin}(M, p_i), \quad p_i \overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta).
\]

Thus, the group-level test outcome $Y_{ij}$ follows:

\[
Y_{ij} \mid p_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\phi_i), \quad \phi_i = 1 - (1 - p_i)^m,
\]

and the observed number of positive groups in the sample is:

\[
t_{yi} \mid p_i \sim \text{Binomial}(b, \phi_i).
\]

 We let $\widetilde{Y}_{ij}$ be the test result for group $j$ in consignment $i$, with 1 denoting a positive result (i.e., apparent contamination) and 0 denoting a negative result (apparently contamination-free). It follows that $\pr \left( \widetilde{Y}_{ij} = 1 \vert Y_{ij} \right) = \Delta Y_{ij} + \left( 1-\Lambda \right) \left(1-Y_{ij}\right)$. The available data are values of $\tilde{t}_{yi}$.


To incorporate **imperfect testing**, we define the effective probability of a positive test as:

\[
\tilde{\phi}_{\Delta\Lambda}(p_i) = \Delta \phi(p_i) + (1 - \Lambda)(1 - \phi(p_i)).
\]


Under perfect specificity ($\Lambda = 1$), this simplifies to:

\[
\tilde{\phi}_\Delta(p_i) = \Delta \phi(p_i).
\]

When $\beta \gg \alpha$, the contamination prevalence $p_i$ is approximately Gamma distributed, leading to:

\[
\tilde{\phi}_{\Delta\Lambda} \sim (1 - \Lambda) + \text{Beta} \left( \alpha, \frac{\beta}{m(\Delta + \Lambda - 1)} \right).
\]

Two important special cases:

* **Perfect testing** ($\Delta = 1$, $\Lambda = 1$): $\tilde{\phi} \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta / m)$,
* **Perfect specificity** ($\Lambda = 1$): $\tilde{\phi} \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta / (m \Delta))$.

In either case, $t_{yi}$ approximately follows a Beta-Binomial distribution:

\[
t_{yi} \sim \text{Beta-Binomial}(b, \alpha, \beta / (m\Delta)).
\]

#### Threshold-Based Risk Estimation

In the context of the prawn biosecurity study, suppose a regulatory threshold is set such that contamination levels below a certain prevalence cut-off are considered acceptable for import. Suppose a regulatory cut-off $k$ is introduced, such that contamination prevalence below $k$ is considered acceptable. The effective prevalence becomes:

\[
p_i = p_i \cdot \mathbb{I}(p_i > k), \quad p_i \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta).
\]

Using this truncated model, the **probability of leakage** becomes:

\[
\Pr[L_i > 0] = \frac{B_{(k_1,1)}(\alpha, \frac{\beta}{m\Delta} + b)}{B(\alpha, \frac{\beta}{m\Delta})} - \frac{B_{(k,1)}(\alpha, \beta + MB)}{B(\alpha, \beta)},
\]

with $k_1 = \Delta(1 - (1 - k)^m)$. Under perfect testing:

\[
\Pr[L_i > 0] = \frac{B_{(k,1)}(\alpha, \beta + mb)}{B(\alpha, \beta)} - \frac{B_{(k,1)}(\alpha, \beta + MB)}{B(\alpha, \beta)}.
\]

When $k = 0$, this reduces to the standard beta-binomial case.

The **expected leakage** under threshold $k$ is:

\[
\mathbb{E}(L_i) = (B - b) M \cdot \mathbb{E}\left[ (1 - p_i)^{bm\Delta} \cdot p_i \cdot \mathbb{I}(p_i > k) \right],
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\mathbb{E}(L_i) = (B - b) M \cdot \frac{B_{(k,1)}(\alpha + 1, \beta + bm\Delta)}{B(\alpha, \beta)}.
\]

#### Model-Based Simulation to Assess Leakage Risk

Using the posterior estimates of Beta parameters $(\alpha, \beta)$, we simulate contamination and testing outcomes for $D = 1000$ consignments of frozen items. Each consignment consists of $B = 8000$ bags, each containing $M = 40$ items. For inspection, $b = 13$ bags are randomly selected, and $m = 5$ items per selected bag are tested using PCR.

For each consignment $i$, the contamination prevalence $p_i \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$ is used to simulate the number of contaminated items per bag:

\[
X_{ij} \sim \text{Binomial}(M, p_i), \quad Y_{ij} = \mathbb{I}(X_{ij} > 0),
\]

where $Y_{ij}$ indicates whether bag $j$ is contaminated. The true and sampled contamination counts are:

\[
T_{yi} = \sum_{j=1}^{B} Y_{ij}, \quad t_{yi} = \sum_{j=1}^{b} Y_{ij}.
\]

To simulate testing, $b$ bags are randomly sampled, and pooled samples of $m = 5$ items per bag are tested using PCR with imperfect sensitivity $\Delta = 0.70$. Contamination detection is adjusted accordingly.

**Test performance is evaluated by comparing true contamination ($T_{yi}$) with the observed number of positive test results ($t_{yi}$):**

* **True Positive (TP):** $T_{yi} > 0$ and $t_{yi} > 0$
* **True Negative (TN):** $T_{yi} = 0$ and $t_{yi} = 0$
* **False Negative (FN):** $T_{yi} > 0$ and $t_{yi} = 0$

False negatives lead to **leakage**, meaning contaminated consignments pass undetected.

This simulation provides estimates of:

* **Probability of leakage**: $\Pr(T_{Xi} > 0 \ \text{and} \ t_{yi} = 0)$
* **Expected leakage**: average number of undetected contaminated items per consignment

These metrics quantify the effectiveness of group testing and support biosecurity decision-making.

#### Case Study: Frozen Seafood Importation in Australia

To illustrate the method, consider a biosecurity context involving the importation of frozen seafood into Australia. Annually, around 800 consignments (batches) are imported, with each batch containing approximately $B = 8000$ bags and each bag has $M=40$ items and so $N=MB$. A simple random sample of $b = 13$ bags is tested per batch. From each selected bag, a group of $m = 5$ items (out of $M = 40$) is randomly selected, leading to $n = bm = 65$ sampled items per batch. Each group of $m$ items is tested using a PCR test with sensitivity $\Delta = 0.80$ and specificity $\Lambda = 1.0$. The only observation per batch is the number of groups testing positive, out of the $b=13$ tested.

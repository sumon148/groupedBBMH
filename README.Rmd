# groupedBBMH

The **groupedBBMH** R package implements a **nested beta-binomial hierarchical model** designed for **group-testing data in biosecurity surveillance**, where the primary goal is to efficiently detect rare contamination events. In routine inspections of imported agricultural consignments, only group-level binary outcomes—positive or negative—are observed, without information on the exact number of contaminated items. This package extends traditional beta-binomial modeling to incorporate **imperfect test sensitivity and specificity**, offering both **exact inference** using a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm and **fast approximate estimation** via a beta-binomial approximation. It supports estimation of contamination levels, quantifies the risk of undetected contamination, and aids in risk-based decision-making through model-based simulation.

To illustrate the method, consider a biosecurity scenario involving the importation of frozen seafood into a country. Suppose there are $D$ consignments (or batches), each consisting of approximately $B$ groups, with each group containing $m$ items — so that the total number of items per batch is $N = mB$.

From each batch, a simple random sample of $b$ groups is selected for group testing. These tests, which screen for pathogens or contaminants, are typically imperfect. We assume a constant sensitivity $\Delta$ — the probability that a test correctly detects infection when it is present — and a constant specificity $\Lambda$ — the probability that a test correctly identifies no infection when it is absent.

For each batch, the only observed outcome is the number of positive groups among the $b$ tested.

Let $X_{ij\ell}$ indicate contamination status (1 = contaminated, 0 = not) for unit $\ell$ in group $j$ of consignment $i$, where $j = 1, \ldots, b$ and $\ell = 1, \ldots, m$. The number of contaminated units in group $j$ of consignment $i$ is $X_{ij} = \sum_{\ell=1}^{m} X_{ij\ell}$, taking values $0, 1, \ldots, m$.

The values $X_{ij}$ are not directly observed. Instead, we observe $Y_{ij} = I(X_{ij} > 0)$, indicating whether any contamination is present in group $j$. We then define:

* $T_{Xi} = \sum_{j=1}^B X_{ij}$: total contaminated units in consignment $i$,
* $t_{xi} = \sum_{j=1}^{b} X_{ij}$: contaminated units in the sampled groups,
* $t_{yi} = \sum_{j=1}^{b} Y_{ij}$: number of sampled groups with contamination, ranging from 0 to $b$.

Let $\tilde{Y}_{ij}$ denote the observed test result for group $j$ in consignment $i$, with 1 indicating a positive result (i.e., apparent contamination) and 0 denoting a negative result (apparently contamination-free). The probability of a positive test results is then 

\[
\Pr \left( \tilde{Y}_{ij} = 1 \vert Y_{ij} \right) = \Delta Y_{ij} + \left( 1-\Lambda \right) \left(1-Y_{ij}\right). 
\]

Thus, the observed data for each consignment consists of $\tilde{t}_{yi}=\sum_{j=1}^{b} \tilde{Y}_{ij}$.

A key quantity of interest is \textbf{leakage}, defined as:

\[
L_i = T_{Xi} \cdot \mathbb{I}(\tilde{t}_{yi} = 0),
\]

representing the number of contaminated items entering undetected when no sampled group tests positive. We focus on:

* the **expected leakage** $\mathbb{E}(L_i)$,
* the **probability of leakage** $\Pr(L_i > 0)$,
* and posterior inference on $T_{Xi}$ when $\tilde{t}_{yi} = 0$.

Now let $p_i$ denote the true prevalence of contamination in batch $i$, and define $\phi_{i} = 1 - (1 - p_i)^m$ as the probability that a group of $m$  items is contaminated. Assuming items are randomly distributed among bags, we have:

\[
X_{ij} \mid p_i \overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \text{Bin}(m, p_i), \quad p_i \overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta).
\]

The group-level test outcome $\tilde{Y}_{ij}$ follows:

\[
\tilde{Y}_{ij} \mid p_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\tilde{\phi}_i), 
\]

and the observed number of positive groups in the sample follows:

\[
\tilde{t}_{yi} \mid p_i \sim \text{Binomial}(b, \tilde{\phi}_i).
\]

where the effective probability of a positive test is: 

\[
\tilde{\phi}_i = \Delta \phi_i + (1 - \Lambda)(1 - \phi_i) ; \quad \phi_i = 1 - (1 - p_i)^m.
\]


Under perfect specificity ($\Lambda = 1$), this simplifies to:

\[
\tilde{\phi}_i = \Delta \phi_i.
\]

When $\beta \gg \alpha$, the contamination prevalence $\beta p_i$ is approximately Gamma distributed, leading to:

\[
\tilde{\phi}_i \sim (1 - \Lambda) + \text{Beta} \left( \alpha, \frac{\beta}{m(\Delta + \Lambda - 1)} \right).
\]

Two important special cases:

* **Perfect testing** ($\Delta = 1$, $\Lambda = 1$): $\tilde{\phi}_i \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta / m)$,
* **Perfect specificity** ($\Lambda = 1$): $\tilde{\phi}_i \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \frac{\beta}{m \Delta})$.

In either case, $\tilde{t}_{yi}$ approximately follows a Beta-Binomial distribution:

\[
\tilde{t}_{yi} \sim \textbf{Beta-Binomial}\ \Bigg(b, \alpha, \frac{\beta}{m \Delta}\Bigg).
\]

#### Threshold-based Risk Estimation

In the context of the frozen seafood biosecurity study, suppose a regulatory threshold is defined such that contamination levels below a certain prevalence cut-off are considered unlikely. Because the virus in question is highly infectious, very small non-zero prevalence values are biologically implausible. If the virus is present, its prevalence is expected to exceed a minimum positive level, denoted by $k$. Thus, $k$ represents a biologically meaningful threshold below which true viral presence is improbable. The effective prevalence can then be expressed as:

\[
p_i = p_i \cdot \mathbb{I}(p_i > k), \quad p_i \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta).
\]

Using this truncated model, the **probability of leakage** becomes:

\[
\Pr[L_i > 0] = \frac{B_{(k_1,1)}(\alpha, \frac{\beta}{m\Delta} + b)}{B(\alpha, \frac{\beta}{m\Delta})} - \frac{B_{(k,1)}(\alpha, \beta + MB)}{B(\alpha, \beta)},
\]

with $k_1 = \Delta(1 - (1 - k)^m)$. Under perfect testing:

\[
\Pr[L_i > 0] = \frac{B_{(k,1)}(\alpha, \beta + mb)}{B(\alpha, \beta)} - \frac{B_{(k,1)}(\alpha, \beta + MB)}{B(\alpha, \beta)}.
\]

When $k = 0$, this reduces to the standard beta-binomial case.

The **expected leakage** under threshold $k$ is:

\[
\mathbb{E}(L_i) = (B - b) M \cdot \mathbb{E}\left[ (1 - p_i)^{bm\Delta} \cdot p_i \cdot \mathbb{I}(p_i > k) \right],
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\mathbb{E}(L_i) = (B - b) M \cdot \frac{B_{(k,1)}(\alpha + 1, \beta + bm\Delta)}{B(\alpha, \beta)}.
\]



#### Model-based Simulation to Assess Leakage Risk

Using the posterior estimates of Beta distribution parameters $(\alpha, \beta)$, we simulate contamination and testing outcomes for $D$ consignments of frozen seafood items. Each consignment consists of $B$ bags, with each bag containing $m$ items. For inspection, a simple random sample of $b$ bags is selected from each consignment and tested using PCR-type assays.

For each consignment $i$, the contamination prevalence $p_i$ is simulated from $\text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$ and is used to simulate the number of contaminated items per bag as 

\[
X_{ij} \sim \text{Binomial}(M, p_i)
\]

which provides the true contamination status of bag $j$ as $Y_{ij} = \mathbb{I}(X_{ij} > 0)$ (i.e., contains at least one contaminated item). The total number of contamination bags in the consignment $i$ is

\[
T_{yi} = \sum_{j=1}^{B} Y_{ij}
\]

and the total number of contamination bags in the sample of size $b$ is

\[
{t}_{yi} = \sum_{j=1}^{b} {Y}_{ij}.
\]

To account for imperfect testing, we simulate observed test results $\tilde{t}_{yi}$ by applying the assumed test sensitivity and specificity to the sampled contamination statuses ${Y}_{ij}$. The observed number of positive test results among the $b$ sampled bags is then 

\[
\tilde{t}_{yi} = \sum_{j=1}^{b} \tilde{Y}_{ij}.
\]

Test performance is evaluated by comparing true contamination status of each consignment ($T_{yi}$) with its observed test outcome $\tilde{t}_{yi}$. Specifically, consignments are classified as:

* **True Positive (TP):** $T_{yi} > 0$ and $\tilde{t}_{yi} > 0$
* **True Negative (TN):** $T_{yi} = 0$ and $\tilde{t}_{yi} = 0$
* **False Negative (FN):** $T_{yi} > 0$ and $\tilde{t}_{yi} = 0$

False negatives lead to **leakage**, meaning contaminated consignments pass undetected into the country.

This simulation framework allows estimation of key biosecurity risk metrics:

* **Probability of leakage**: $\Pr(T_{Xi} > 0 \ \text{and} \ \tilde{t}_{yi} = 0)$,
* **Expected leakage**: the average number of contaminated items undetected per consignment.

These metrics help to quantify the effectiveness of group testing strategies and inform decision-making in biosecurity risk management.



#### Case Study: Frozen Seafood Importation in Australia

A case study, drawn from a real biosecurity context, serves as the primary motivation for our modeling approach. The data are included in this package for illustration and reproducibility.

Each year, approximately 800 consignments (batches) of frozen seafood are imported into Australia. Each batch contains roughly $B = 8000$ bags, with each bag holding $M = 40$ items, yielding a total of $N = MB$ items per batch.

A simple random sample of $b = 13$ bags is selected from each batch for testing. From each selected bag, a group of $m = 5$ items (out of $M = 40$) is randomly chosen, resulting in $n = bm = 65$ sampled items per batch. Each group of $m$ items is tested using a PCR assay, which is assumed to have a sensitivity of approximately $\Delta = 0.80$ and near-perfect specificity, $\Lambda = 1.0$.

The only observation recorded per batch is the number of groups testing positive, out of the $b = 13$ groups tested.

These data motivate the development of models for estimating contamination prevalence, quantifying the risk of undetected contamination (leakage), and evaluating testing strategies under imperfect diagnostic accuracy.

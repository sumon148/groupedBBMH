\title{Compute Expected Leakage and Probability of Leakage from Model-based Simulation Output}
\usage{
compute_simulated_leakage(sim_object)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim_object}{A simulation result object returned by the main simulation function,
typically structured with elements: \code{Simulation_Tx}, \code{Simulation_tx}, and
\code{Simulation_Infection_Ty_Results}.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{E.Li}{Expected leakage per batch (mean undetected infections)}
\item{P.Li}{Probability of leakage per batch}
\item{Median.Li}{Median leakage per batch, conditional on leakage occurring}
\item{Pseudo.E.Li.median}{Pseudo-expected leakage = P.Li × Median.Li}
\item{Median.Li.Overall}{Overall median leakage across all batches/simulations}
\item{P.Li.Overall}{Overall probability of leakage}
\item{Pseudo.E.Li.Overall}{Overall pseudo-expected leakage}
}
}
\description{
This function computes batch-level and overall leakage statistics based on the output
of a simulation object generated by the package's core simulation functions
\code{simulate_infection_sampling} and \code{run_infection_simulations}.
}
\details{
Leakage is defined as the number of undetected infections in a batch, particularly in
the presence of false negatives (FN). The function computes expected leakage, probability
of leakage, and pseudo-expected leakage (i.e., probability × median leakage).

The function calculates:
\itemize{
\item \strong{E.Li}: Expected leakage per batch (mean of undetected infections)
\item \strong{P.Li}: Probability of leakage (proportion of simulations with FN)
\item \strong{Median.Li}: Median leakage, conditional on leakage > 0
\item \strong{Pseudo.E.Li.median}: Product of P.Li and Median.Li
\item \strong{Overall statistics}: Same metrics aggregated across all batches/simulations
}

The function assumes false negatives are encoded as \code{3} in the \code{Simulation_Infection_Ty_Results}
matrix, and treats these as missed infections when computing leakage.

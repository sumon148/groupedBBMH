\title{Summarize MCMC Chains with Diagnostics}
\usage{
summary_mcmc(..., varnames)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more MCMC outputs. For multiple chains, each parameter should be
passed as a list of numeric vectors (one per chain). For a single chain, pass each
parameter as a single numeric vector.}

\item{varnames}{A character vector of parameter names (must match the number of parameters).}
}
\value{

}
\description{
This function provides a summary of MCMC output, including mean, standard deviation,
quantiles, Gelman-Rubin diagnostics (R-hat), effective sample size (n_eff), and
efficiency ratios for multiple chain inputs. It supports both single-chain and multiple-chain (chained) inputs.
}
\examples{
# --- Example 1: Single-chain input (vectors for alpha and beta) ---
set.seed(123)
alpha <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0.005, sd = 0.1)
beta <- rnorm(1000, mean = 5, sd = 0.2)

result_single <- summary_mcmc(alpha, beta, varnames = c("alpha", "beta"))
print(result_single$summary_mcmc)


# --- Example 2: Multiple chains (list of vectors per parameter) ---
set.seed(456)
n_iter <- 1000

# Simulate three chains for each parameter
alpha_chains <- list(
  rnorm(n_iter, mean = 0.005, sd = 0.1),
  rnorm(n_iter, mean = 0.005, sd = 0.1),
  rnorm(n_iter, mean = 0.005, sd = 0.1)
)

beta_chains <- list(
  rnorm(n_iter, mean = 5, sd = 0.5),
  rnorm(n_iter, mean = 5, sd = 0.5),
  rnorm(n_iter, mean = 5, sd = 0.5)
)

# Run the summary
result_multi <- summary_mcmc(alpha_chains, beta_chains, varnames = c("alpha", "beta"))
print(result_multi$summary_mcmc)

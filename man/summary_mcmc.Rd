\title{Summarize MCMC Chains with Diagnostics}
\usage{
summary_mcmc(..., varnames)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more MCMC outputs. For multiple chains, each parameter should be
passed as a list of numeric vectors (one per chain). For a single chain, pass each
parameter as a single numeric vector.}

\item{varnames}{A character vector of parameter names (must match the number of parameters).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{summary_mcmc}{A data frame with summary statistics for each parameter:
Mean, SD, quantiles (2.5\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, 97.5\%), R-hat, n_eff, and n_eff_ratio.}
\item{n_eff_chain}{A list of effective sample sizes per chain.}
\item{n_eff_ratio_chain}{A list of effective sample size ratios per chain.}
}
}
\description{
This function provides a summary of MCMC output, including mean, standard deviation,
quantiles, Gelman-Rubin diagnostics (R-hat), effective sample size (n_eff), and
efficiency ratios for multiple chain inputs. It supports both single-chain and multiple-chain (chained) inputs.
For multiple chain, convergence related statistics are calculated.

\examples{
# --- Example 1: Single-chain input (vectors for alpha and beta) ---
set.seed(123)
alpha <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0.005, sd = 0.1)
beta <- rnorm(1000, mean = 5, sd = 0.2)

# --- Example 2: Multiple chains (list of vectors per parameter) ---
set.seed(456)
n_iter <- 1000

# Simulate three chains for each parameter

# Run the summary
